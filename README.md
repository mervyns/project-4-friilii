# friilii - P2P Insurance Community for Freelancers
With the rise of the Gig Economy, the number of freelancers in Singapore has increased. However, this means that a larger proportion of our population do not enjoy the same benefits which the "traditionally-employed" do, such as sick leave, medical insurance and transport claims.

friilii is Singapore's first P2P insurance community that allows you to purchase insurance to insure yourself against loss of income, medical emergencies, or transport claims.

## Tech Stack:
### Server
- Express

### Front-End
- React
